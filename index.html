            <div class="section-title">Chicken</div>
            <p>The chicken is a bird that people all over the world raise for its meat, eggs, and feathers. It belongs to the group of domesticated, or tame, birds called poultry. Chickens have short wings and a heavy body. This makes it hard for them to fly very far. Exact size varies greatly among breeds, as does color. In many breeds, both sexes will have fleshy skin folds on the chin and atop the head, known as wattles and combs, respectively.</p>
